#IPS Triplog
Created at the 2015 [Indy Civic Hack](http://techpoint.org/indy-civic-hack/). Our team attacked the issue of IPS (Indiana Public Schools) not having a centralized place to track how far their drivers are driving in order to reimburse them.

This mobile application is for use with the drivers, and it is accompanied by an administration panel that can be used to process the submitted trip data.

A video describing and demoing the entire application suite can be found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mAqXvVd94).

This application communicates with the backend Node.JS API through RESTful HTTP requests.

##Features
- Allows the user to login and store the authorization ID in local storage so that the use can be remembered.

- Drivers can begin/end trips, having their GPS coordinates tracked and marked on the map displayed on-screen.
