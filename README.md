#IPS Triplog
Created at the 2015 [Indy Civic Hack](http://techpoint.org/indy-civic-hack/). Our team attacked the issue of IPS (Indiana Public Schools) not having a centralized place to track how far their drivers are driving in order to reimburse them.

This mobile application is for use with the drivers, and it is accompanied by an administration panel that can be used to process the submitted trip data.

A video describing and demoing the entire application suite can be found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mAqXvVd94).
